# bytebase_instance (Resource)

The instance resource. You can read, create, update or delete a single instance through `bytebase_instance` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new instance with identifier "dev-instance"
resource "bytebase_instance" "dev_instance" {
  resource_id = "dev-instance"
  title       = "dev instance"
  engine      = "POSTGRES"
  environment = "dev"

  data_source_list {
    title    = "admin data source"
    type     = "ADMIN"
    username = "<The connection user name>"
    password = "<The connection user password>"
    host     = "127.0.0.1"
    port     = 5432
  }
}

# Create another instance with identifier "tidb-instance"
resource "bytebase_instance" "tidb_instance" {
  resource_id = "tidb-instance"
  title       = "tidb instance"
  engine      = "TIDB"
  environment = "dev"

  data_source_list {
    title    = "admin data source"
    type     = "ADMIN"
    username = "<The connection user name>"
    password = "<The connection user password>"
    host     = "127.0.0.1"
    port     = 4000
    ssl_ca   = file("ssl_ca_file_path")
    ssl_cert = file("ssl_cert_file_path")
    ssl_key   = file("ssl_key_file_path")
  }
}
```
