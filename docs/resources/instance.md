# bytebase_instance (Resource)

The instance resource. You can read, create, update or delete a single instance through `bytebase_instance` resource.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a new instance named "dev-instance"
resource "bytebase_instance" "dev_instance" {
  name        = "dev-instance"
  engine      = "POSTGRES"
  host        = "127.0.0.1"
  environment = "dev"
  port        = 5432

  data_source_list {
    name     = "admin data source"
    type     = "ADMIN"
    username = "<The connection user name>"
    password = "<The connection user password>"
  }
}
```
